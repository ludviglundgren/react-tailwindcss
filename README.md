# Tailwind CSS + React

This is a test project for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) and React via CRA.

> Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

Tailwind is different from frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Bulma in that it's not a UI kit.

It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components.

## Usage

Install dependencies

    yarn

Start

    yarn start

This will start react and watch `src/css/tailwind.src.css` for changes and build them with PostCSS.

Build css separatley

    yarn build
